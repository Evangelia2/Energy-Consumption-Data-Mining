# Data Mining Project – Household Power Consumption

This project analyzes real-world household energy consumption data to identify usage patterns, support data-driven decision making, and demonstrate the application of core data mining techniques.
It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights from time-series power usage data.
A full technical report is included for detailed project documentation.
